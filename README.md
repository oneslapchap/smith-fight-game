# smith-fight-game

<b>General info</b><br>
This side project was started by me back in 2013-06-01 and was abandoned on 2013-09-01 as I had to study and had less free time. It's currently in a very early pre-alpha stage. You can check it out on Youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/VwHpw8WweeA">here</a>.

<b>What's the game about?</b><br>
The idea of the game was that you are a weapon smith and you had to:
<ol>
  <li>Get an order from a soldier or a wizard.</li>
  <li>Smith the weapons that were ordered as well as you can</li>
  <li>Send them of into battle with the weapons you just made</li>
  <li>Fight the creatures encountered and use skills</li>
</ol>

<b>What tools are used for game creation?</b><br>
<a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">Libgdx</a>

<b>What platforms was the game intended for?</b><br>
It was intended for android, but as it uses libgdx framework, it can work on almost any other platform.

<b>How to run the game?</b><br>
The easiest way to run it is in Eclipse by running the desktop variant. This is how you do that:
<ol>
  <li>Pull the project from github to some directory.</li>
  <li>Run any Eclipse client that supports Java and import the project.</li>
  <li>Open steel-desktop->src->com.me.steel->Main.java and press Run.
  <li>You did it!</li>
</ol>
